# Bell.minus ‚è≥

Bell.minus is a more stripped down implentation of [Nicolas Chan's bell.plus](https://github.com/nicolaschan/bell). This implentation uses Typescript and [@types/p5](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/p5) to utilize p5.js for graphics.

This project is geared towards being used as a XenHTML widget for jailbroken apple devices.
